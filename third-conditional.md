# Third Conditional

It is used to express an alternative behavior based on a different (imaginary) event in the past. One example could be to express regret.

## Parts
1. if + subject +  past perfect (had + [not] + infinitive):
    * describes an alternative past situation (different from the actual past situation)
2. Subject + would [not] + present perfect (have + infinitive):
    * describes the result
    * _could, should, may_, and _might_ can be used instead of _would_. (see [First Conditional](./first-conditional.md))

## Examples
* If I __had been__ sick, I __would have gone__ to the doctor.
* If we __had looked__ at the weather report, we __would have stayed__ home!
* If I __had known__ you were visiting, I __would have made__ time to see you!
* If I __had worked__ harder, I __would have passed__ the exam!
* If I__'d worked__ harder, I __would've passed__ the exam! (spoken)
* If I __hadn't eaten__ that ice-cream, I __wouldn't have felt__ so sick!
