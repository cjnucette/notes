# First Conditional

We use the first conditional to talk about possible/real future/present situations and their possible results. You can make promises, threats, warnings, logical consequences, offers. It also can be used to negotiate or make a deal.

## Parts
1. (If | When) + subject + present simple [not]:
    * _describes a possible (if) or a real (when) future or present situations_.
    * _if + not_ can be replaced with _unless_.
2. subject + will [not] + infinitive:
    * _describes a result_.
    * _would, be going to, could, should, may_, and _might_ can be used instead of _will_.
        * Will/be going to: most likely.
        * Might/may: less likely.
        * Should: advice.
        * Would: advice.
        * Could: suggestion.

## Examples
* If I lose my umbrella, I will buy another one. (possible situation)
* If I lose my umbrella, I might buy another one. (less likely result)
* When I lose my umbrella, I will buy another one. (real situation)
* If I visit Mexico, I will stay with my friends.
* They will go to the beach if it's sunny. (clauses position can be changed, no comma needed)
* If Micheal passes his exams, we'll have a party for him. (contracted form)
* I might buy you dinner tonight, Sophie, if you're nice to me! (less likely).
* You shouldn't use the kettle **if** it is**n't** working properly. (if + not)
* You shouldn't use the kettle **unless** it is working properly. (unless)

## Real life examples.
* If you want to undo the last 4 changes, you would use `4u`.
