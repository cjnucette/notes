## Performance Increases:

* Modulation Scheme: 1024 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) bit per symbol.
* Spatial Streams: 8 X 8 - MU-MIMO: Multiple streams connect with multiple users simultaneously. Only works if there is enough spatial diversity (physical distance between each individual client)
* Channel Bonding: 80Mhz & 160Mhz - Joining channels together.
* Airtime Efficiecy: OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) and BSS coloring (transmition management)
