# Second Conditional

It is used to talk about impossible, unlikely or imaginary situations, and to give advice.
To ask hypothetical questions, or to give reasons why.

## Parts
1. if + subject + _simple past_ [not]:
    * _describes an imaginary situation_
2. subject + **would [not]** + **infinitive**:
    * _describes a possible result_.
    * _could, should, may_, and _might_ can be used instead of _would_. (see [First Conditional](./first-conditional.md))


## Examples
* If England _won_ the World Cup, Catherine **would be** so happy.
* We **would be** so happy if England _won_ the World Cup.
* If Sunny _had_ more money, he **would get** a better phone.
* I **Wouldn't see** you very often if I _lived_ in the city.
* Maria **would have** a better job if she _spoke_ more English.
