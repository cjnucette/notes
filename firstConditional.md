# First Conditional

We use the first conditional to talk about possible/real future/present situations and their possible results. You can make promises, threats, warnings, logical consequences, offers. It also can be used to negotiate or make a deal.

## Parts
1. if + subject + present simple (not): _describes a possible (will) or a real (when) future situations_.
2. subject + will (not) + infinitive: _describes a result_.

Note: _would, be going to, could, should, may_, and _might_ can be used instead of _will_.
  * Will/be going to: most likely.
  * Might/may: less likely.
  * Should: advice.
  * Would: advice.
  * Could: suggestion.

Note: if + not can be replaced with _unless_.

Note: change _if_ with _when_ when you are talking about a real situation.


## Examples
* If I lose my umbrella, I will buy another one.
* If I lose my umbrella, I might buy another one. (less likely result)
* When I lose my umbrella, I will by another one. (real situation)
* If I visit Mexico, I will stay with my friends.
* They will go to the beach if it's sunny.
* If Michal passes his exams, we'll have a party for him.
* I might buy you dinner tonight, Sophie, if you're nice to me! (less likely).
* You shouldn't use the kettle if it isn't working properly.
* You shouldn't use the kettle unless it is working properly.

## Real life examples.
* If you want to undo the last 4 changes, you would use `4u`.
